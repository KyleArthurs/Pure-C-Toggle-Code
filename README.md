Simple-Toggle-Code 
This code is a c based arduino program that allows you to toggle components on and off using the serial monitor as an input


Currently the USART library is not mine but i am working on my own version and I hope to have it released soon 

To use the code: 
1. upload code to your Arduino board
2. Open the Serial Monitor 
3. Enter the letter T (in caps) 
4. The onboard light should toggle On/Off

It should be noted that there is a bug where the light will stay on the first time you enter the toggle input, I am working on this after I complete my own USART library
